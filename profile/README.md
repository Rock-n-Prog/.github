# Rock n' Prog :love_you_gesture:	

Yo. Welcome to [@ExiledNarwal28](https://github.com/ExiledNarwal28)'s home.

Rock n' Prog is just a namespace for stuff I wanna build and showcase. It's things I try, things I use, things I love.

## Core ideologies

- **Developper experience** above all else
- Leave room for **R&D and openness**
- **Continuous deployments** renders agile sprints useless
- **A metric is not an objective**
- **Functional programming** is a must
- Keep it **simple**, stupid
- **Continous improvements**
- **Collective ownership**
- Always **refactor things iteratively**
- **Only test what deserves it**
- A defined and applied **code style** is a must

## Stack-independant principles

- UI components are to be considered as a unit of logic, templating and styling
- Reactive UI architectures are preffered
  - No need for complex patterns, `react-query` as such-as does 99% of the job
- RPC is the closest we can get to call server functions directly, so use it if possible
